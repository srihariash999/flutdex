Pokemon (endpoint)
Pokémon are the creatures that inhabit the world of the Pokémon games.
They can be caught using Pokéballs and trained by battling with other Pokémon.
Each Pokémon belongs to a specific species but may take on a variant which makes it differ from other Pokémon of the same species, such as base stats, available abilities and typings.
See Bulbapedia for greater detail.
